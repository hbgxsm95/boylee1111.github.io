I'm Boyi Li (李博一), a senior student in [TONGJI University](http://www.tongji.edu.cn/english/), China. My major is **Software Engineering**.

####Professional####
As a fast-learning developer, I'd already involed into many different development skills. Among all programming languages, `Objective-C` and `C#` are my specialists. But I never limit myself to some specific skills or domains. The world is changing with an unprecedented speed, epscially the IT industry. So I take myself as a person who can meet the challenges positively and react to the changes rapidly. And [Here](/résumé) is more details about my career.

####Hobbies####
As an addicted runner. I was crushed on this clean, efficient and unlimited exercise way since the first time I ran on playground. And I've participated in several running activities, like Shanghai Marathon, which I really enjoyed.

And I'm also interested in Chinese martial arts, exactly, Kungfu. I've been learning *Wing Chun* for several years. I regard myself as a person who is still on the way from novice to intermediate.

In addition, I'm passionate to explore unknown things, and enjoyable from changing my lifestyle.

####Organizations####

I'm a key member of Tongji Apple Club, which is an extraordinary student organization that concentrates on design and development based on the most modern techonologies provided by Apple Inc.. It's the lukiest and the most excite thing ever that I could be the fellow and work together with these brilliant guy who share the same hobby with me.
