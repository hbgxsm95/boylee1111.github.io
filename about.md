<h4>Professional</h4>

I am a passionate practitioner and developer, whose interest lies on cloud computing, distributed system, and mobile development. I'm greatly eager to convert what I've learned into application. I contributed container storage orchestration open source project [REX-Ray](https://github.com/rexray/rexray) and attended WWDC 15 before.

Currently, I'm interning in PayPal and working for a home-grow cloud orchestration solution. And during my working as technical support engineer, I worked on delivering solutions based on Microsft Azure distributed directory to customer. These experiences gave solid basis and insights regarding modern cloud platform.

[Here]({{ site.baseurl }}/cv) is my resume if you're insterested.
