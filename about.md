I'm Boyi Li (李博一), gradute from [TONGJI University](http://www.tongji.edu.cn/english/), Shanghai. My major is **Software Engineering**. Currently I'm **Support Engineer** working at Microsoft Corporation, Shanghai.

<h4>Professional</h4>

As a developer at student period, I'd already involed into many different development skills. Among all programming languages, `Objective-C` and `C#` are my specialists.

Currently as support engineer, I assit on delivering solution to customer located in Southeast Asia, Austrilian and New Zealan related to Exchange and Outlook product.

But I never limit myself to some specific skills or domains. The world is changing with an unprecedented speed, epscially the IT industry. So I take myself as a person who can meet the challenges positively and react to the changes rapidly. And [Here]({{ site.baseurl }}/résumé) is more details about my career.
