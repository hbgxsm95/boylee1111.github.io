I'm Boyi Li (李博一), a senior student in [TONGJI University](http://www.tongji.edu.cn/english/), China. My major is **Software Engineering**.

####Professional####
As a fast-learning developer, I'd already involed in many different development skills. Among all programming languages, `Objective-C` and `C#` are my specialists. But I never limit myself to some specific skills or domains. The world is changing with an unprecedented speed, epscially the IT industry. And I take myself as a person who meets the challenges positively. [Here](/résumé) is more details about my career.

####Hobbies####
I'm an addicted runner. I was crushed on this clean, efficient and unlimited exercise way since the first time I ran on playground. And I have participated in several running activities, like Shanghai Marathon.

In addition, I'm passionate to explore unknown things, and enjoyable from changing my lifestyle.

###About This Blog###
This blog is not just limited to development articles. I will keep posting anything about my life, my thoughts, etc.. And maybe these posts will keep me one day.
